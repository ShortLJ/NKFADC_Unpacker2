# NKFADC_Unpacker2

## Unpacking from a list

```
./NKFADC_Unpacker -i list.txt
```

is not suggested. It has problem when processing timestamp RESET (maximum hit, or MTE reboot). 

SUBSTITUTE:

```bash
./Offline_list.sh <batchname>.txt <N>
```

A user need to modify INPUT_DATA_PATH, and OUTPUT_BASE.
Output `ROOT` files will be stored in directory `OUTPUT_BASE/batchname`.
